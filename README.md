## Installation

### Option 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
3. Search for "Jackery" in the integrations section
4. Click "Download" and restart Home Assistant

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `jackery` folder to your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Jackery" and select it
4. Enter your Jackery account credentials:
   - **Username**: Your Jackery account email/username
   - **Password**: Your Jackery account password
5. Click **Submit**

The integration will automatically discover your Jackery devices and create sensors for each one.

## Usage

Once configured, you'll find your Jackery devices and their sensors in:
- **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Entities**
- Each device will have its own set of sensors

You can use these sensors in:
- **Dashboards**: Create custom dashboards to monitor your power station
- **Automations**: Set up automations based on battery level, power status, etc.
- **Templates**: Use sensor values in templates for custom calculations

### Example Automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Low Battery Alert"
    trigger:
      platform: numeric_state
      entity_id: sensor.jackery_device_remaining_battery
      below: 20
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Jackery battery is low: {{ states('sensor.jackery_device_remaining_battery') }}%"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your Jackery account credentials
   - Ensure your account is active and not locked

2. **No Devices Found**
   - Make sure your Jackery device is connected to the internet
   - Verify the device is registered to your account

3. **Sensors Not Updating**
   - Check the Home Assistant logs for errors
   - Verify your device has internet connectivity

### Logs

To enable debug logging, add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.jackery: debug
```
